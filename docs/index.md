# Winterbloom's order queue

Hi there! We know you're eager to get your order, so we made this page that will let you know where you are in our shipping queue. We generally ship orders first-in first-out (oldest first), but sometimes we'll ship smaller orders ahead of others. This page is updated daily.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to [send us an email](mailto:support@winterbloom.com).

## Pre-order queue

Pre-orders are placed in a separate queue. Once we're ready to start shipping, these orders will move to the shipping queue. Please note that the "held until" date is an estimate of when we will have the items in stock to fulfill the order, it's not an estimate of when the order will ship.
