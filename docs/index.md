# Winterbloom's order queue

Hi there! We know you're eager to get your order, so we made this page that will let you know where you are in our shipping queue. We generally ship orders first-in first-out (oldest first), but sometimes we'll ship smaller orders ahead of others. This page is updated daily.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to [send us an email](mailto:support@winterbloom.com).

## Shipping queue

This queue is for orders that contain items that are in stock, basically, no pre-orders. The pre-order queue is [in the next section](#pre-order-queue).

## Pre-order queue

Pre-orders are placed in a separate queue. Once we're ready to start shipping, these orders will move to the shipping queue.

!!! note "When will my order ship?"
    Hydrogen and Helium pre-orders are still expected to ship in February. We had a delay with the remainder of our front panels and we're awaiting their arrival. Once those get here we'll be able to ship all of those pre-orders quickly, since that's the last step in assembly for us.
